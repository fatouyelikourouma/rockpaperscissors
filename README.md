HTML/CSS/Javascript Rock Paper Scissors Web App

This is my first project using 100% vanilla javascript in a responsive web app. I used a tutorial to help with all sides of the process, though I mostly did the HTML and CSS by myself. I learned a lot of important Javascript concepts, especially about DOM and Functions, and hope to expand my knoweldge by creating more solo projects wihtout a guided tutorial.
